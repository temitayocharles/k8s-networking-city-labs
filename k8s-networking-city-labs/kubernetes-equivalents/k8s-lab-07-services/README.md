## Purpose
This lab focuses on a single networking concept mapped to the city model.
Complete all steps sequentially.

## Scenario Description
In Kubernetes, services provide stable access points to pods, routing traffic based on selectors. This is analogous to a front desk routing visitors to apartments in the city model. This lab guides you through creating a service, testing access, and observing the abstraction.

## Steps
See [steps.md](./steps.md) for detailed instructions.

## Objectives
