## Scenario Description
In Kubernetes, the node bridge (e.g., cni0, flannel.1, cilium_host) aggregates pod interfaces, providing Layer 2 connectivity within a node. This is analogous to a hallway connecting apartments in the city model. This lab guides you through identifying and inspecting the node bridge and its connections.
