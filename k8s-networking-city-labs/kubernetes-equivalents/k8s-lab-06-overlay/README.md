## Scenario Description
In Kubernetes, overlay networks (e.g., VXLAN) encapsulate pod traffic to enable communication across nodes with flat addressing. This is analogous to city roads connecting distant buildings. This lab guides you through inspecting overlay interfaces, observing encapsulation, and testing cross-node pod connectivity.

## Steps
See [steps.md](./steps.md) for detailed instructions.

## Objectives
See [objectives.md](./objectives.md) for learning goals.

## Verification
See [verification.md](./verification.md) for how to confirm the lab outcome.

## Cleanup
See [cleanup.md](./cleanup.md) for environment restoration.
