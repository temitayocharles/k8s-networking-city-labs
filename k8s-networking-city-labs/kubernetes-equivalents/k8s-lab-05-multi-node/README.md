## Scenario Description
In Kubernetes, multi-node networking enables pods on different nodes to communicate, often using overlays or tunnels. This is analogous to roads connecting different buildings in the city model. This lab guides you through observing pod communication within and across nodes, and inspecting overlay interfaces.

## Steps
See [steps.md](./steps.md) for detailed instructions.

## Objectives
See [objectives.md](./objectives.md) for learning goals.

## Verification
See [verification.md](./verification.md) for how to confirm the lab outcome.

## Cleanup
See [cleanup.md](./cleanup.md) for environment restoration.
