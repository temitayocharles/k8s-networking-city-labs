## Scenario Description
In this lab, the "Building" represents a node in the city analogy. Multiple apartments (network namespaces) are aggregated within a single building (node), all connected to a common bridge (br-hallway). This setup demonstrates how nodes aggregate pods and provide Layer 2 connectivity in Kubernetes networking.
