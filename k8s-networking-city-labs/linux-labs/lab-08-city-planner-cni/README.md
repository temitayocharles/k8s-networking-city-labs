## Scenario Description
In this lab, the "City Planner" represents the Container Network Interface (CNI) in Kubernetes. You will automate pod networking setup using a shell script, mimicking how CNIs allocate IPs, create veth pairs, and attach them to bridges. This demonstrates how CNIs automate the manual networking steps learned in previous labs.
